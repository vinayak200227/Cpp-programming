8. Give an expression for the runtime T (n) if the recurrence can be solved with the Master Theorem :
   T (n) = 64T (n/8) − n^2log n

/*
The given recurrence relation T(n) = 64T(n/8) - n^2log n can be solved using the Master Theorem. 
Let's express the runtime T(n) in terms of the Master Theorem:

T(n) = a * T(n/b) + f(n)

In this case, we have:
a = 64
b = 8
f(n) = -n^2log n

Now, let's compare f(n) with n^log_b(a):

n^log_b(a) = n^log_8(64) = n^2

Since f(n) = -n^2log n, it is smaller than n^2. Thus, we fall into Case 1 of the Master Theorem:

If f(n) = O(n^c) for some constant c < log_b(a), then T(n) = Theta(n^log_b(a)).

In our case, c = 1 and log_b(a) = log_8(64) = 2. Since c < log_b(a), we have f(n) = O(n^c).

Therefore, according to the Master Theorem, the runtime T(n) for the given recurrence relation is:

T(n) = Theta(n^log_b(a)) = Theta(n^2).

Hence, the runtime of the recurrence relation T(n) = 64T(n/8) - n^2log n is Theta(n^2).
