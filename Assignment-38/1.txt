1. What is the time, and space complexity of the following code:

int a = 0, b = 0;
for (i = 0; i < N; i++) {
a = a + rand();
}
for (j = 0; j < M; j++) {
b = b + rand();
}

// Answer //

/*
The time complexity of the given code is O(N + M), 
where N and M are the loop iterations for the first and second loops, respectively. This is because each loop iterates N and M times, respectively.

The space complexity of the code is O(1) because it uses a constant amount of additional memory to store the variables a, b, i, and j. 
The space required does not depend on the input size (N or M), so it is considered constant space complexity.
