3. What is the time complexity of the following code:

int i, j, k = 0;
for (i = n / 2; i <= n; i++) {
for (j = 2; j <= n; j = j * 2) {
k = k + n / 2;
}
}


// Answer //

/*
The time complexity of the given code is O(n log n), where n is the value of the variable n.

The outer loop runs n/2 times, where n is the value of the variable n. 
The inner loop runs log n times because j is doubled in each iteration (2, 4, 8, ..., n).

So, the total number of iterations for the inner loop can be calculated as log n. 
Therefore, the time complexity of the inner loop is O(log n).

Since the outer loop iterates n/2 times, the time complexity of the code is O((n/2) * log n), 
which simplifies to O(n log n) asymptotically.
