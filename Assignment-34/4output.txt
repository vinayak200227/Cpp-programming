tHE i/o SYSTEM OF c++ CONTAINS A SET OF CLASSES WHICH DEFINE THE FILE HANDLING METHODS. tHESE INCLUDE IFSTREAM, OFSTREAM AND FSTREAM CLASSES. tHESE CLASSES ARE DERIVED FROM FSTREAM AND FROM THE CORRESPONDING IOSTREAM CLASS. tHESE CLASSES, DESIGNED TO MANAGE THE DISK FILES, ARE DECLARED IN FSTREAM AND THEREFORE WE MUST INCLUDE THIS FILE IN ANY PROGRAM THAT USES FILES.
