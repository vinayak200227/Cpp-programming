1. ios:-

ios stands for input output stream.
This class is the base class for other classes in this class hierarchy.
This class contains the necessary facilities that are used by all the other derived classes for input and output operations.

2. istream:-

istream stands for input stream.
This class is derived from the class ‘ios’.
This class handle input stream.
The extraction operator(>>) is overloaded in this class to handle input streams from files to the program execution.
This class declares input functions such as get(), getline() and read().
 
3. ostream:-

ostream stands for output stream.
This class is derived from the class ‘ios’.
This class handle output stream.
The insertion operator(<<) is overloaded in this class to handle output streams to files from the program execution.
This class declares output functions such as put() and write().

4. streambuf:-

This class contains a pointer which points to the buffer which is used to manage the input and output streams.

5. fstreambase:-

This class provides operations common to the file streams. Serves as a base for fstream, ifstream and ofstream class. 
This class contains open() and close() function.
6. ifstream:-

This class provides input operations.
It contains open() function with default input mode. 
Inherits the functions get(), getline(), read(), seekg() and tellg() functions from the istream.

7. ofstream:-

This class provides output operations.
It contains open() function with default output mode. 
Inherits the functions put(),  write(), seekp() and tellp() functions from the ostream.

8. fstream:-

This class provides support for simultaneous input and output operations.
Inherits all the functions from istream and ostream classes through iostream.

9. filebuf:-

Its purpose is to set the file buffers to read and write.
We can also use file buffer member function to determine the length of the file.
